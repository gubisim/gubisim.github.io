          <p>
            It all started with Tinder in a little place called Logan Utah. Over
            the course of a year and a half we ran into each others profiles and
            each time there was something that drew us to each other and we
            matched. We talked a little bit and even exchanged phone numbers but
            for some reason we never could seem to get a date together.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the fall of 2015 we matched a final time and were able to finally
            set up a date, which Cassidy canceled, once... and then twice (She
            was sick, give her a break already.) Brad thought his chances were
            not looking so good but felt like she genuinely wanted to go out.
            Desipte feeling like a desperate fool, Brad, set up a date with
            Cassidy for a 3rd time. On November 18th, 2015, it finally happened.
            We met up to go for Liege Waffles at The Waffle Iron (who would
            later cater our wedding reception). All the pains, aches, and
            awkwardness of a first date seemed to not exist. Their was an
            instant level of comfort, understanding of each others sense of
            humor, and connection formed that night.

          <div class="card-title">The Proposal</div>
          <p>
            We continued to date and fall in love over the next several months
            and on June 9th, 2016, Brad popped the big question. In Cassidy's
            words "he took me to dinner at the waffle iron, where we had our
            first date. After that he told me we were going to go to "the block"
            (a huge concrete block by the canyon in Logan that looks over all of
            cache valley) where we went on our third date. As we were walking on
            the little path in between tons of bushes that leads to the block we
            turned a corner and all of the sudden I saw a bunch of tiny candles
            flickering, lanterns all throughout the trees, and on top of the
            block I saw a couch. The couch that was in the apartment of where
            Brad lived last year when we started dating. This couch is very
            special, it's where we first held hands, cuddled, had our first
            kiss, where he first told me he loved me, and where we first talked
            about marrying each other. I love how many happy memories this couch
            has and constantly have told Brad how much I miss it since he moved
            to a new place for the summer. He went to his old apartment and
            asked the strangers who now live there if he could borrow it for
            this special night. I could not believe what I was seeing. I sat on
            the couch (freaking out and saying oh my gosh over and over) and
            Brad got down on one knee, told me the sweetest things I've ever
            heard, and asked me to marry him. I cannot believe that he asked ME
            to be his future wife!!!"
